            <h1 id="h1">Classification of Colors</h1>
        <p id="p1">
            Colors can be organized on a color wheel and grouped into three main categories: primary colors, secondary colors, and tertiary colors.
            Primary colors include red, blue, and yellow. Primary colors cannot be created from other colors, instead they are used to mix and create all the other colors.
            Secondary colors are created by mixing two primary colors. Secondary colors include orange, green, and violet.
            Tertiary or intermediate colors are made by mixing primary and secondary colors. Blue-violet and yellow-green are examples of tertiary colors.
            Complementary colors are colors from opposing segments of the color wheel. Analogous colors are colors that are side by side on the color wheel.

            <h1 id="h2">Color Temperature</h1>
        <p id="p2">
            Colors on the red side of the color wheel are considered warm. Colors on the green side of the wheel have colors that are considered cool.
            Warms colors tend to appear closer and can evoke strong emotions. They stand out, which is why they're often used for warning signs like stop signs and radiation warning symbols.
            Cool colors are relaxing and soothing. They are more passive than the active warm colors. Cool colors tend to appear more distant than warm colors.
            Neutral colors are hues that lack color; they include colors like white, black, gray, brown, and beige. Neutral colors are easy on the eye, which makes them perfect for backgrounds.

            <h1 id="h3">Color Blindness</h1>
        <p id="p3">
            Color blindness is a genetic condition which affects around 8% of men and 0.5% of women.
            Your eyes use three types of cones to detect blues, greens, and reds. The resulting color is formed by looking at the ratio of light that each type of cone receives.
            Color blindness can occur when one type of cone is impaired or missing. 
            Keep this in mind if you're creating something for people who might struggle to distinguish between colors. For example, it may help to use contrasting colors to make it easier for color blind people to distinguish between colors.
            Viewing your creation in grayscale and seeing if the individual elements are distinguishable can also be a great way to make sure everyone has a great viewing experience.

            <h1 id="h4">How Colors are Displayed</h1>
        <p id="p4">
            Each pixel on your screen is made up of a red, green, and blue subpixel. Each subpixel will light up with the right intensity to create specific colors. 
            Different monitors and screens use slightly different technologies to actually display the data to your eyes. For example, pixels can be backlit by a panel or individually lit.
            A computer has to send data to a monitor for the color values of each individual pixel in order to accurately display an image or video.

            <h1 id="h5">Trademarked Colors</h1>
        <p id="p5">
            Specific colors can actually be trademarked by a company. If a specific color is widely recognized to be linked to a certain company, then it has the possibility of being trademarked by that company.
            Some trade marked colors include #ff6720 for Home Depot and #c8102e for Target.
            These companies can use these trademarked colors to deter other competitors from using it.
            If you're ever designing something for a company, keep this in mind so they don't get sued.
